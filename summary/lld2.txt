# Milestone Management Backend â€“ Project Summary

## Introduction
The Milestone Management Backend is an enterprise-grade, modular Spring Boot application designed to facilitate Milestone Progress Tracking and Milestone Search & Analytics for project management scenarios. It offers robust features for calculating and caching milestone progress, searching and analyzing milestones with advanced filters, and securing endpoints through role-based JWT authentication. The application is built with scalability, maintainability, and security in mind, following best practices in software architecture and design.

## System Architecture
The application follows a layered architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting maintainability:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses, exposing RESTful APIs for clients.
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulates business logic, orchestrating operations between controllers, repositories, and external services.
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data persistence, leveraging Spring Data JPA for relational databases and integrating with Elasticsearch for advanced search and analytics.
- **Security Layer**: Implements JWT-based authentication and authorization, securing endpoints and managing user roles.
- **Exception Handling**: Provides global exception handling for consistent and informative error responses.

### Primary Use Cases
- **Milestone Progress Tracking**: Calculate, cache, and retrieve progress statistics for project milestones.
- **Milestone Search & Analytics**: Search, filter, and analyze milestones using KPIs and date range filters.
- **Role-based Authentication**: Secure access to endpoints, ensuring only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.

## Technology Stack
- **Java 17+**: Modern language features and long-term support.
- **Spring Boot 3.x**: Rapid development and robust ecosystem.
- **Spring Data JPA**: ORM for database interactions.
- **Spring Security (JWT)**: Stateless, token-based authentication and authorization.
- **Elasticsearch**: High-performance search and analytics capabilities.
- **H2/PostgreSQL**: Configurable relational database support for development and production.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Interactive API documentation and testing.
- **SLF4J**: Unified logging across all modules.

## Key Design Decisions
- **Layered Architecture**: Promotes separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.
- **DTO Usage**: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used to decouple API contracts from internal entities, ensuring clean data flow between layers.
- **Service Abstraction**: Business logic is encapsulated in service interfaces and implementations, allowing for easy extension and testing.
- **Caching**: Progress statistics are cached to optimize performance and reduce redundant computations.
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Enables advanced search and analytics on milestone data, supporting complex queries and KPI calculations.
- **Global Exception Handling**: Ensures consistent error responses and improved client experience.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: SLF4J-based logging is implemented across all modules for traceability and monitoring.

## Security and Best Practices
- **JWT-based Authentication**: All endpoints are secured using stateless JWT tokens, ensuring robust authentication and authorization.
- **Role-based Access Control**: User roles are enforced at the endpoint level, restricting access to sensitive operations.
- **Input Validation**: DTOs and controller methods include validation annotations to prevent invalid or malicious data from entering the system.
- **Global Exception Handling**: A centralized exception handler provides meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes.
- **DTO Separation**: DTOs are used to prevent overexposing internal entities and to maintain a clear contract with API consumers.
- **Service-layer Abstraction**: Business logic is encapsulated in services, decoupling it from controllers and repositories.
- **Database Handling**: Uses JPA for ORM, with support for both H2 (development) and PostgreSQL (production). Configuration is managed via `application.yml`.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI is integrated for interactive API exploration and testing.
- **Logging**: SLF4J ensures consistent and configurable logging across the application.
