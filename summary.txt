# Milestone & Release Management Backend - Project Summary

## Introduction
This Spring Boot application is an enterprise-level backend system for managing project and group milestones, as well as associating releases. It is designed with modularity, security, and maintainability in mind, following best practices and robust validation as per the provided Low-Level Design (LLD). The application supports the full lifecycle of milestones and releases, with role-based authentication and comprehensive documentation.

## System Architecture
The application adopts a layered architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns:
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses, orchestrating the flow between client and service layers.
- **Service Layer**: Implements business logic, validation, and orchestration of domain operations.
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data persistence using JPA/Hibernate ORM.
- **Security Layer**: Enforces authentication and authorization using JWT tokens and role-based access control.
- **DTO Layer**: Facilitates clean data transfer between layers, decoupling internal models from external APIs.
- **Exception Handling**: Provides global and custom exception handling for robust error management.

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Creation, update, and closure of project/group milestones
- Association of releases with milestones
- Secure, role-based access to milestone and release management endpoints

## Technology Stack
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Security (JWT-based authentication)
- Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
- H2 Database (in-memory, for demonstration)
- Lombok (for reducing boilerplate code)
- Swagger/OpenAPI (for API documentation)
- Maven (build tool)
- SLF4J (logging)

## Key Design Decisions
- **Service-Layer Abstraction**: All business logic is encapsulated in service classes, promoting testability and maintainability.
- **DTO Usage**: Data Transfer Objects are used for all API requests and responses, ensuring a clean contract and decoupling from internal entities.
- **Global Exception Handling**: A centralized exception handler provides consistent and meaningful error responses across the API.
- **Modular Package Structure**: The codebase is organized by feature and responsibility, supporting scalability and clarity.
- **Role-Based Security**: JWT tokens and Spring Security enforce fine-grained access control.
- **Validation Layer**: Input data is rigorously validated both at the DTO and service levels to ensure data integrity.
- **Swagger Integration**: API documentation is auto-generated and accessible via Swagger UI for developer convenience.

## Security and Best Practices
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: All sensitive endpoints are protected using JWT tokens, ensuring secure, stateless authentication.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Access to endpoints is restricted based on user roles, preventing unauthorized actions.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation is applied to all incoming data to prevent invalid or malicious input.
- **Global Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions and a global handler provide clear, consistent error messages and HTTP status codes.
- **DTO Separation**: DTOs are used to separate internal models from external APIs, reducing coupling and increasing security.
- **Database Handling**: JPA/Hibernate is used for ORM, and the application is configured for easy migration to production databases.
- **Logging**: SLF4J is used for structured logging throughout the application.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI provides interactive and up-to-date API documentation.

### Package Responsibilities
- **controller**: Handles all HTTP endpoints for milestone and release management. Delegates business logic to the service layer.
- **service**: Contains interfaces and implementations for business logic, validation, and orchestration.
- **repository**: Provides CRUD and query operations for Milestone and Release entities using Spring Data JPA.
- **entity**: Defines the data model for persistence, including Milestone and Release entities.
- **dto**: Contains request and response objects for API communication, ensuring decoupling and validation.
- **config**: Holds configuration for Swagger, security, JWT, and web settings.
- **security**: Implements authentication, user details, roles, and JWT utilities.
- **exception**: Custom exceptions for domain and validation errors, plus a global exception handler for unified error responses.
- **util**: Utility classes for common operations (e.g., date handling).

## Conclusion
This backend system is production-ready, modular, and secure, following enterprise standards for design, validation, and documentation. It is easily extensible for future requirements and can be integrated into larger project management platforms.
