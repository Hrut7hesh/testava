# Spring Boot

## Overview
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal configuration. It simplifies the development process by providing defaults for code and annotation configuration.

## Key Features
- **Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures Spring applications based on the dependencies present in the project.
- **Standalone Applications**: Easily create stand-alone, production-ready applications.
- **Embedded Servers**: Supports embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, eliminating the need for external deployment.
- **Production-Ready**: Includes features such as health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration.
- **Minimal Configuration**: Reduces boilerplate code and configuration requirements.

## Getting Started
1. **Add Spring Boot Starter Dependency**
   - Use Maven or Gradle to add the appropriate starter dependency.
2. **Create Main Application Class**
   - Annotate with `@SpringBootApplication`.
3. **Run the Application**
   - Use `SpringApplication.run()` method or run from the command line.

## Example
```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

## Common Starters
- `spring-boot-starter-web`: For building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC.
- `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: For Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
- `spring-boot-starter-security`: For adding Spring Security.

## Benefits
- Rapid application development
- Easy integration with Spring ecosystem
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Built-in monitoring and management
