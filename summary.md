# Project Summary: Spring Boot Backend Application

## Introduction
This Spring Boot backend application is designed to provide a robust, modular, and enterprise-ready foundation for managing Milestone and Release entities. It features a comprehensive REST API with secure authentication, validation, and documentation, making it suitable for scalable business solutions.

## System Architecture
The application follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns, ensuring maintainability and extensibility. Key use cases addressed include:
- Managing Milestone and Release entities with full CRUD operations
- Enforcing business rules and validation at the service layer
- Providing secure, authenticated access to API endpoints
- Delivering self-documented APIs for easy integration

### High-Level Components
- **Controllers**: Expose RESTful endpoints for all business operations
- **Services**: Encapsulate business logic and validation
- **Repositories**: Abstract data access using JPA/Hibernate
- **Entities & DTOs**: Define data models and transfer objects
- **Security**: JWT/OAuth2-ready stubs for authentication and authorization
- **Exception Handling**: Centralized error management

## Technology Stack
- **Spring Boot**: Core application framework
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization (JWT/OAuth2-ready)
- **Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)**: ORM and database access
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation and testing
- **SLF4J**: Logging
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management
- **H2 Database**: In-memory DB for development (configurable)
- **application.yml**: Centralized configuration
- **logback-spring.xml**: Logging configuration

## Key Design Decisions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between controller, service, and repository layers
- **DTO Usage**: All external data transfer is handled via DTOs, ensuring encapsulation and validation
- **Service Abstraction**: Business logic resides in service interfaces and implementations, decoupling it from controllers
- **Global Exception Handling**: Centralized handler for consistent error responses
- **Validation Annotations**: Ensures data integrity at DTO and entity levels
- **Swagger Integration**: Provides interactive API documentation for developers and integrators
- **Modular Package Structure**: Each concern is isolated in its own package for clarity and scalability

## Security and Best Practices
- **JWT/OAuth2 Authentication (Stubs Provided)**: Ready for secure token-based authentication and authorization
- **Input Validation**: DTOs and entities use validation annotations to prevent invalid or malicious data
- **Global Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions and a global handler ensure consistent, informative error responses
- **Logging**: SLF4J with Logback for structured, configurable logging
- **Configuration Management**: All environment-specific settings are managed via `application.yml`
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI for discoverable, testable endpoints
- **Separation of Concerns**: Strict adherence to SOLID and enterprise design principles
