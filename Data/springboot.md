# Spring Boot

## Overview
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal configuration.

## Key Features
- **Auto-configuration**: Automatically configures Spring and third-party libraries whenever possible.
- **Standalone**: Creates applications that can run independently without relying on external web servers.
- **Production-ready**: Provides built-in features such as health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration.
- **Opinionated Defaults**: Offers sensible defaults to reduce boilerplate code and configuration.

## Getting Started
1. **Add Spring Boot Starter**: Use Maven or Gradle to include a starter dependency.
2. **Create Main Application Class**:
   ```java
   @SpringBootApplication
   public class Application {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Run the Application**: Execute the main method or use build tools to start the application.

## Common Starters
- `spring-boot-starter-web`: Build web applications, including RESTful services.
- `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: Integrate Spring Data JPA for database access.
- `spring-boot-starter-security`: Add authentication and authorization.

## Benefits
- Rapid development and deployment
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow)
- Easy integration with Spring ecosystem

## Useful Commands
- `mvn spring-boot:run` or `./gradlew bootRun`: Run the application.
- `mvn clean package`: Build the application JAR/WAR.
