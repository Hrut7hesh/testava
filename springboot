Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications with minimal configuration. It simplifies the setup and development of new Spring projects by providing defaults for code and annotation configuration. Key features include embedded servers (like Tomcat), auto-configuration, production-ready metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration. Spring Boot eliminates boilerplate code, accelerates development, and is widely used for building microservices and RESTful APIs.
